# BLT Web Interface

## Overview
The primary objective of this project is to make BLT more usable and available to students, faculty, and staff. I decided to create an interface that someone could log in to, so they could send/view jobs to the endpoints as well as access their files. 

## What I Learned
I gained some experience with using supercomputers, specifically BLT. While working on the interface, I learned a little bit of HTML and Javascript. I also learned about using Python Flask with AJAX requests to manage logins and route users to the appropriate page. While doing all this, I was able to gain experience in working on a programming project on a more professional level, and this was my biggest takeaway from this project.

## What Comes Next
The next steps in the project would be to integrate a database with the web interface to track and manage users. Other features that need to be implemented are transfering files to and from BLT as well as displaying statistics to administrators about the current use of BLT to help manage it.

## Other Stuff
Ben Glick was looking for a CS student to join his project, and that is how I became involved with this. He helps a lot, and he is teaching me along the way.
